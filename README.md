# Getting Started with contact-list React App

Use node version 16.14.2

## About project

This web application is my study process of using React, TypeScript and Mobx. [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) is used as a component library.

The personal account application consists of 2 pages: the authorization page and the contact list. To simulate authorization, the fake REST API [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) is used, so to log in to the account, use the user with the login `welcome` and password `123456`.

## How to run app

In the project directory, you should run 2 scripts:

`npm run start` 

`npm run jsonServer`
